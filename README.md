## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js (LTS) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (recommended for frontend)
*   MySQL Server (with a database named `finance_db` and a user `root` with password `root`)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-management-dashboard.git
cd financial-management-dashboard
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run migrations.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt # Ensure all dependencies are covered

# Ensure your MySQL server is running and the 'finance_db' database exists.
# If you haven't created it, log into MySQL and run: CREATE DATABASE finance_db;

# Run database migrations (if using Alembic, otherwise models are created on startup)
# Alembic setup is beyond this README's scope, but models will be created by FastAPI on first run.
# For manual table creation on first run with FastAPI, ensure Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) is uncommented in main.py

# Run the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.

```bash
cd ../frontend
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install
bun run dev

# Using npm
# npm install
# npm run dev
```
The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://10.13.52.179:8080` if accessing from other devices on your local network).

## Usage

1.  **Register**: Navigate to the `/signup` page to create a new user account.
2.  **Login**: Use your registered credentials on the `/login` page.
3.  **Dashboard**: After logging in, you will be redirected to the dashboard, showing your financial overview.
4.  **Add Financial Input**: Use the "Manual Financial Input" card on the dashboard to add your monthly salary, expenses, and investments. Select the month and year, then click "Save". These will be saved as transactions.
5.  **Explore**: Navigate through different sections using the sidebar (Transactions, Tax Summary, Investments, Forecasts, Recommendations, Reports).

## Design Notes

*   **Rounded Corners**: `rounded-2xl` is used throughout the UI for a modern, soft aesthetic.
*   **Soft Shadows**: `shadow-md` is applied to cards and key elements to give depth without being overly heavy.
*   **Animations**: `Framer Motion` is integrated for smooth transitions, fade-in, and slide-in effects.
*   **Charts**: `Recharts` provides interactive and customizable data visualizations.
*   **Color Palette**: A modern, clean, finance-friendly palette with a primary blue, accent cyan, and subtle grayscale for backgrounds and text.
