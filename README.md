## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Node.js (LTS) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (recommended for frontend)
-   MySQL Server (with a database named `finance_db` and a user `root` with password `root` - these can be configured in `backend/app/config.py`)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-dashboard.git
cd personal-finance-dashboard
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the server.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt

# Run the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a *new* terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.

```bash
cd frontend
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install
bun run dev

# Using npm
# npm install
# npm run dev
```

The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar, check your terminal output).

### 4. Training the Fraud Detection Model (Optional)

To train the IsolationForest model for fraud detection:

```bash
python backend/app/ml/train_fraud_model.py
```

This script will train the model and save it for use by the FastAPI application.
